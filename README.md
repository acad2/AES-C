# AES IMPLEMENTATION

This repository contains an AES Implementation wrote in C with MASK countermeasure.

## Build

Compile source code with gcc compiler:

```c
gcc aes.c -o aes
```

## Usage

//TODO

## MASK Countermeasure

The MASK countermeasure applied attempts to protect implementations of cryptographic algorithms.

Protects against common power analysis type attacks:

* SPA
* DPA
* HODPA

## Inspiration

A project inspired by:

* Announcing the ADVANCED ENCRYPTION STANDARD (AES).
* An Implementation of DES and AES, Secure against Some Attacks.
